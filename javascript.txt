js is a synchronous in nature and it can be changed into asynchronous using async await, promises and callback

js is a single threaded ,

js is as well as interpreted as compiled because of v8 engine .

product .

monolith = all code will be in a one codebase on the time of deploying we put code on VPS (virtual private server)
latency and throughput that can be improved using HLD(high level design) or LLD (low level design ).
always give first priority to LLD.

there are some LLD patterns 
1. singleton pattern
2. factory method 



to solve latency we need to optimize the server first 
1.	horizontal scaling 
2.	vertically scaling 


Vertical scaling = improving hardware of server to boost speed

horizontal scaling = increasing the no of servers.

js can be run on 
1. brower
2. but outside browser we need Node.js
GEC consists of two parts 
1. memory
2. execution
phase 1 :- memory space allocation 

phase 2:- varibale decleration and execution 

in execution art due to a function a execution context creats and after the work comletes the context will delete imidiatly 


diff btw VAR and LET 

VAR                                                                     LET

redeclare                                                              value assign
value assign                                                           strict

-three types of errors 
1.syntax error 
2.typeerror
3.refrence error


temporal dead zone - the time btw phase 1 and phase 2 .

Function 

arrow function 

function expression ex var xyz()=>{}
named funcdion 
anonymous function 

lexical environment and lexical scope 

grandparent - parent - child 

top to bottom not possible bottom to top possible
